# Object-Detection_Project
Machine Learning Project with different models ( SVM , ANN , Random Forest , Decision Tree)   

Developed an object detection system using SVM, ANN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms.
Conducted experiments to compare the performance of each model in terms of accuracy and processing time.
Optimized the models through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
Built a GUI to showcase the object detection system, allowing users to upload images and see the model's 
predictions in real-time.
Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning algorithms, computer vision techniques, and programming languages 
such as Python.
